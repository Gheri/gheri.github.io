        <h3>Staff Software Engineer, Warner bros Discovery (Aug 2021 - Present)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Grooming Backlog, Tech/Design Analysis, Sign Ups, Mentoring. Lead the entire cycle of <br>
software and delivery from tech analysis to deployment.</li>
            <li>Implement integrations with demand/exchange partners in US and EMEA. This enables to optimize its <br>
yield for revenue and consumer experience in tandem. Ensured E2E development cycle from scoping <br>
requirements, development to deployment & monitoring. It was released with high quality standards and <br>
improved latency. </li>
        <li>Improved higher yield of ad breaks by implementing Wrapper Ad fetch Optimization. It helped Product <br>
team to decide tradeoff between Customer experience (VST) and Revenue(ads). It improved Ad Fill <br>
Rate and reduction of Inventory Waste. </li>
        <li> R&D on Next Gen SSAI Architecture by experimenting advanced DASH features on Roku/dash.js <br>
player. This would help system to reduce infra cost while supporting high concurrency & scale, improve <br>
ad performance and providing flexibility for the use of dynamic Ad loads, improve consumer experience <br>
by reducing video startup times.</li>
